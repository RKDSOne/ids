# SyncConf
`SyncConf` is developed to make `IDS` project portable, and flexible to share `conf.json` to any projects.

## WHAT in `conf.json`

- `path`: the root path of the project
- `dpath`: the root path of the data
- `confpaths`: distributed and consistent path list containing all the paths where `conf.json` exists in the project. 

## HOW to use `SyncConf`
